# GEMCLUS - A package for discriminative clustering using GEMINI

The **gemclus**  package provides simple tools to perform discriminative clustering using the generalised mutual
information (GEMINI).
The package was written to be a scikit-learn compatible extension.

You can find the complete documentation of the package here: `Link to be announced`

## Installation

Use the following instruction for installing the package:

```commandline
pip install gemclus
```

The library requires a couple scientific package to run:

+ NumPy
+ Scipy
+ POT
+ Scikit-learn

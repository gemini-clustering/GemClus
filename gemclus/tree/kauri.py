class Kauri(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator, ABC):
    """
    Implementation of the `KMeans as unsupervised reward ideal` tree algorithm. This model learns clusters by
    iteratively performing splits on different nodes of the tree and either assigning those nodes to new clusters
    or refurbishing them to already existing one according to some kernel-guided gain scores.

    Parameters
    ----------

    max_clusters : int, default=3
        The maximum number of clusters to form.

    max_depth: int, default=None
        The maximum depth to limit the tree construction. If set to `None`, then the tree is not limited in depth.

    min_samples_split: int, default=2
        The minimum number of samples that must be contained in a leaf node to consider splitting it into two new
        leaves.

    min_samples_leaf: int, default=1
        The minimum number of samples that must be at least in a leaf. Note that the logical constraint
        `min_samples_leaf`*2 <= `min_samples_split` must be satisfied.

    max_features: int, default=None
        The maximal number of features (randomly selected) to consider upon the choice of splitting a leaf.
        If set to `None`, then all features of the data will be used.

    max_leaves: int, default=None
        The maximal number of leaves that can be found in the tree. If set to `None`, then the tree is not limited
        in number of leaves.

    kernel: {'additive_chi2', 'chi2', 'cosine','linear','poly','polynomial','rbf','laplacian','sigmoid', 'precomputed'},
        default='linear'
        The kernel to use in combination with the MMD objective. It corresponds to one value of `KERNEL_PARAMS`.
        Currently, all kernel parameters are the default ones.
        If set to 'precomputed', then a custom kernel must be passed to the `y` argument of the `fit` or `fit_predict`
        method.


    verbose: bool, default=False
        Whether to print progress messages to stdout

    random_state: int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Determines random number generation for feature exploration.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_: ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The cluster in which each sample of the data was put
    tree_: Tree instance
        The underlying Tree object. Please refer to `help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)` for attributes of Tree object.
